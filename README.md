# Weather App

A simple desktop Weather App built using Python's `tkinter` for the graphical interface and `requests` to access live weather data from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

## Overview

This Weather App allows users to input the name of a city and retrieve the current weather conditions including:
- **Country**
- **Weather description (main)**
- **Temperature (in Â°C)**

It serves as a beginner-friendly project showcasing how to interact with APIs and create GUIs using Python.

## Features

- **Real-time Weather Data:** Retrieves and displays current weather details for the specified city.
- **User-friendly GUI:** A minimalist design using `tkinter` with custom colors and fonts.
- **Error Handling:** If the city is not found, the application informs the user to enter a valid city.
- **Easy Customization:** Modify the colors, API key, or other UI components as needed.
